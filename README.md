2. Copy ***DlibDotNet.dll***, ***DlibDotNetNative.dll*** and ***DlibDotNetNativeDnn.dll*** to output directory; &lt;WebcamFacePose_dir&gt;\bin\Release\netcoreapp2.0.

**NOTE**  
- You should build ***DlibDotNetNative.dll*** and ***DlibDotNetNativeDnn.dll*** with CUDA.
- If you want to run at Linux and MacOS, you should build the **DlibDotNet** at first.

Actually, sample source uses WebCam attached on computer.  
But this README uses video file because DlibDotNet owner hesitates to use own face to demonstrate.
